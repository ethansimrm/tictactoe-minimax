# tictactoe-minimax

This is my basic re-creation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe in the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science.

Due to the highly specific nature of the GUI, it only works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_9vDqwebfHt_32.py.

You will play against a bot which uses a Minimax strategy to determine the best move. The programme envisions the possible end-game states in a recursive (and tree-like) manner and chases the most optimal outcome. This is slightly more advanced than the Monte Carlo bot, so good luck!
